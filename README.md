# STAT 424 Project—STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
## Language: JMP PRO 15
### Course Description:
  Introduction to statistical design and analysis of experiments. Topics include: principles of randomization, blocking and replication, randomized blocking designs, Latin square designs, full factorial and fractional factorial designs and response surface methodology. Substantial focus will be devoted to engineering applications. 

* Experiment description:

  Our experiment looks at the uncommonly known fact that putting raisins in a carbonated beverage will make them appear to dance in the beverage. This is due to the bubbles of carbonation getting caught in the wrinkles of the raisin as they rise to the surface of the container. As more bubbles get caught under the raisin, it becomes more buoyant and rises to the top. However, the uneven shape of a raisin causes its elevation to be uneven which allows for some bubbles to escape its wrinkles. The result is a raisin that moves sporadically in the beverage. Some refer to this as “Dancing Raisins.” 
  In our experiment, we investigate various factors that can influence the release of carbon dioxide bubbles. We decided to use the time a raisin is suspended in the beverages as a way to measure this quantitatively. 

* Type of  hypothesis test:

  * ANOVA test
